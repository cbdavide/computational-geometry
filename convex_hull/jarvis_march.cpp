/**
 * Jarvis March Algorithm - (Gift Wrapping)
 *
 * This algorithms finds the Convex Hull of a set of points A, identifying a
 * pivot point (the lowest then leftmost one), and finding the next point from it.
 *
 * To select the next point that belongs to the CH, it takes the point that makes
 * the minimum left turn from the actual point.
 *
 * Â¿ How to find the next point s that achieves the minimum left turn ?
 *
 * Being k the current point (last point founded by the algorithm), and a point s
 * that is partially selected, for each point different from s and p, called t, if
 * t is to the right of the segment ks then t takes a minor left turn than s
 * so we should  update s to t.
 *
 * This implementations returns the CH ordered in CW with respect the lowest then
 * leftmost point.
 *
 * Complexity: O(n ^ 2)
 * This algorithm is output-sensitive (It's time execution depends of the size
 * of the output CH)
